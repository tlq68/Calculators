# Calculators

The Process
------------

This was a marvelous process that allowed me to think for myself and use many of the tools that I learned from the Odin Project. I broke the process down into 3 or 4 large parts and then completed subdivisions of each task. I started with the HTML, followed by the CSS, just so I could have a visual representation of what I was working with. Then I began to work on hooking the keyboard keys up to my new calculator. I decided to start with the keyboard, even though TOP only suggests it as a bonus feature, because I wanted something that I could use to quickly input numbers and operations for fast testing. 

After I finished the initial setting up, it was time to get into the JavaScript. I started with the simple operations and quickly realized that I would have to make some adjustments because it wasn't exactly as simple as just creating an add function that adds two variables together. I needed to make sure that I was storing values in the proper order. Eventually, I made variables for the two number inputs and the operator and stored all of these in another variable to be displayed. 

I slowly started to chip away at problems. Like, issues with hitting enter with no values, not being able to chain operations together, having too many leading zeroes (which I decided to use regexes for. I'm sure there's a simpler way, but I liked that I could customize what I was looking for), and some problems with big numbers. 

At some point in the process, I realized that the output was being given as the number type and I decided to take advantage of this for the sake of chaining operations and using the backspace key. I wanted the calculator to delete everything if you press the backspace button right after the enter button, but I only wanted it to clear one digit at a time otherwise. 

After I finished fixing everything up the way I wanted it, I returned to the CSS and added a few things for a little bit of flare. 

This was a wonderful project and I look forward to continuing TOP!
